# BankerBot: A Smart Banking Chatbot

Welcome to the **BankerBot** project! This README provides an overview of the project, the technologies used, and the steps taken to create a smart banking chatbot using Amazon Lex and AWS Lambda.

## Project Overview

**BankerBot** is a conversational interface designed to assist users with various banking tasks such as checking account balances, transferring funds, and making payments. The bot leverages Amazon Lex for natural language understanding and AWS Lambda for backend processing.

## Key Features

- **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**: Utilizes Amazon Lex to understand and process user inputs.
- **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)**: Supports voice interactions for a more engaging user experience.
- **Multi-Platform Deployment**: Can be deployed on web, mobile, and messaging platforms.
- **Scalability**: Automatically scales to handle a large number of interactions.

## Technologies Used

- **Amazon Lex**: For building the conversational interface.
- **AWS Lambda**: For backend processing and fulfillment of user requests.
- **AWS CloudFormation**: For automating the deployment of the bot.
- **AWS Management Console**: For managing and configuring AWS services.

## Skills Highlighted

- **Chatbot Development**: Crafting a chatbot from scratch using Amazon Lex.
- **Backend Integration**: Integrating AWS Lambda for real-time data processing.
- **Error Handling**: Designing fallback intents to manage unclear user requests efficiently.
- **Custom Slot Types**: Employing custom slot types for precise user input handling.
- **Cloud Automation**: Using CloudFormation to automate the deployment process.

## Project Steps

### 1. Creating the Bot

- **Setup**: Created a new bot in the Amazon Lex console, specifying the bot's name, language, and output voice.
- **Intents**: Defined multiple intents such as `WelcomeIntent`, `CheckBalanceIntent`, `TransferFundsIntent`, and `MakePaymentIntent`.

### 2. Adding Training Phrases

- **Training Phrases**: Added a variety of training phrases for each intent to help the bot understand different ways users might phrase their requests.

### 3. Defining Slots and Slot Types

- **Slot Types**: Specified custom slot types to ensure data collected was in the correct format.

### 4. Creating Fulfillment Logic

- **AWS Lambda**: Developed Lambda functions to handle the fulfillment of user requests. For example, retrieving account balances and processing fund transfers.

### 5. Testing and Iteration

- **Testing**: Used the test window in the Amazon Lex console to simulate user interactions and refine the bot's responses.
- **Iteration**: Made necessary adjustments based on test results to improve accuracy and user experience.

### 6. Deployment

- **CloudFormation**: Automated the deployment process using AWS CloudFormation.
- **Multi-Platform**: Deployed the bot across various platforms, including web and mobile applications.

### 7. Monitoring and Optimization

- **Analytics**: Monitored the bot's performance using Amazon Lex's built-in analytics.
- **Optimization**: Identified common user queries and made adjustments to improve the bot's accuracy and efficiency.
